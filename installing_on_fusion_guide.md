## Important 

By default we provide host-only adapter by default. By using this type of adapter, youâ€™ll be able to access a private, virtual network consisting solely of your host and any guests. Any of the member machines can access each other, but you can't access outside traffic i.e. Internet.

If you need internet access, consider changing the network adapter from 'Private to my Mac' to '**Share with my Mac**' (although, this is Mac specific similar steps apply for Windows/Linux OS) and reboot.
